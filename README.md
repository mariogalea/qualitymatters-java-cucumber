A Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Tool for Writing Acceptance Tests Using the Gherkin Language
Our tool leverages Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles to facilitate the writing of acceptance tests. It utilizes the Gherkin language, which is designed to be easily readable and understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. By using this tool, teams can define clear and concise acceptance criteria that bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation.
