## Tool Overview

A Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Tool for Writing Acceptance Tests Using the Gherkin Language.
This tool leverages Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles to facilitate the writing of acceptance tests. 
It utilizes the Gherkin language, which is designed to be easily readable and understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. 

By using this tool, development teams can define clear and concise acceptance tests, covering acceptance criteria that bridges the gap 
between business requirements and technical implementation.

## API Test Sample - Why using CRUD?

All tests are using a dummy api example located below:

This provides basic CRUD operations, which will allow a full demo of all possible scenario examples of the Gherkin 
Language: Scenario, Scenario Outline and Scenarios with Data Tables.  Backgrounds are also included.
